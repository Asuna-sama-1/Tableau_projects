## **Introduction:**
This is an analysis of the Global Greenhouse Gas(GHG) emissions from the electricity generation system. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of greenhouse gas emissions of all the countries and the combustion of both fossil and non-fossil fuels. This study also discussed the available approaches, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and time-caring carbon intensity method, to measure greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generation system. Comparisons of all types of greenhouse gas emissions and electricity generation fuel sources in different countries are presented in this paper by using the data visualization tool Tableau. The result showed that some countries are increasing, some are decreasing, some are semi-stable in terms of GHG emissions. The result also showed the impacts of both fossil fuel and non-fossil fuel energy usage countrywide and worldwide. 

### Prep

This project acquired skills to clean, combine data using join and union, shape and pivot the data using Tableau Prep. Tableau Prep is an ETL (Extract Transport Load) tool that allows us to extract data from different locations, transform and then generate output in. hyper and .csv formats.
